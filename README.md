# SWE_Project
SWE20004 Group Project

The data folders will already have all of the necessary data. If it doesn't detect it delete the data folder and run MakeData.exe first since it will input information to the database as seen in "Sample Data.xlsx".
Then You can run SWE_Project.exe for the information.

If you want to run the test.exe (Unit Tests) make sure you remove the Data Folder and make sure you define testing in database.h (It is Commented)
Then if you want to try the main again delete the data folder and then just run MakeData.exe then the SWE_Project.exe

If using Visual Studio you should see an option called current document with a green run symbol. There will be a dropdown in this button. Click that and you will see SWE_Project.exe, MakeData.exe and Test.exe.

I will also provide the executables in a different folder for further testing.
